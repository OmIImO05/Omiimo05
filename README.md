### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Introduction
I am Shabiha Hossain. Currently studying as a first year PhD student at Geography and Sustainability in The University of Tennessee. Previously I worked on  a couple of projects like micro-plastic, waste management, trace metals in tap water and sediments. Recently my interest widened its horizon to incorporate GIS and Remote Sensing on environmental changes and risk assessment. Although I don't have any coding experience prior coming here however, I am making time to try myself to learn about this. I find it interesting how it simplify our lives! 


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on to develop a research proposal under [Dr. Liem Tran](https://geography.utk.edu/people/instructional-faculty/tran-liem/)

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Geographic Software Design and LiDAR

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Geospatial Data Science

ðŸ“« How to reach me: sabihahossain4105@gmail.com

âš¡ Fun fact: Overthink how impressive I could be!
